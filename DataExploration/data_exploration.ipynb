This method embraces recycling and reuse, taking a significant stride towards a circular economy.   Modular construction involves utilizing engineered components in a manufacturing facility that are later assembled on-site. These components are designed for easy disassembling, enabling them to be reused in diverse projects, thus significantly reducing waste and conserving resources.  Not only does this method decrease construction waste by up to 90%, but it also decreases construction time by 30-50%, optimizing both environmental and financial efficiency. This reduction in time corresponds to substantial financial savings for businesses. Moreover, the modular approach allows greater flexibility, adapting to changing needs over time.  We believe, by adopting modular construction, the industry can transit from a 'take, make and dispose' model to a more sustainable 'reduce, reuse, and recycle' model, driving the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future. The feasibility of this concept is already being proven in markets around the globe, indicating its potential for scalability and real-world application.\n"]}],"source":["print(earthhack_df['solution'][0])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["(1300, 3)\n","3900\n","Index(['id', 'problem', 'solution'], dtype='object')\n"]}],"source":["print(earthhack_df.shape)\n","print(earthhack_df.size)\n","print(earthhack_df.columns)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Landfills are filling up with post-consumer waste from the textile industry, which consists of non-degradable material, harmful chemicals, and dyes.

The uniqueness of this solution lies in the added layer of customization and making it into an ecosystem. It combines clothing rental, repair, artist promotion, and textile recycling in one model.  The clothing rental service would work like the previous model, but be subscription-based to provide more flexibility. A points-based currency could also be introduced, which would allow subscribers to avail higher-value items at discounted rates.   An innovation that could set this idea apart is promoting “wearable art” – partnering with local artists to customize clothing items for an additional fee, promoting local art culture, plus bringing uniqueness into the rental catalog.   To make this model circular, post-consumer and post-rental clothes beyond repair could be sent to partnered recycling plants, where they will be treated and turned back into raw textile materials to produce new clothes.   This enhanced model provides significant environmental benefits by reducing textile waste generation, promoting reuse and recycling of clothes. Customizations and recycling efforts can create additional revenue streams while supporting local artists and recycling industries.   As for feasibility and scalability, digital platforms and logistics companies can make this operation feasible on a large scale, while partnerships with artists and recycling factories can enable further expansion. A well-implemented model that addresses potential concerns about cleanliness, quality, and variety, as well as a positive marketing campaign showcasing the environmental and financial benefits to consumers, can increase its acceptability. Hence, the solution is not only feasible and scalable, but it also improves community engagement and the green credentials of the fashion industry.\n"]}],"source":["print(earthhack_df['solution'][30]) "]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"databundleVersionId":2703900,"sourceId":19018,"sourceType":"competition"}],"dockerImageVersionId":29860,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":false,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
